🔥 Fire Fighting Robot using Arduino Uno

A smart Arduino-based robot designed to detect and extinguish fire autonomously.

🧠 About the Project
This project demonstrates a fire-fighting robot using an Arduino Uno, equipped with flame sensors, a DC fan, motor driver, and GSM module for alerts. The robot autonomously detects fire, navigates toward the source, and extinguishes it while sending SMS alerts to a predefined mobile number.

🎯 Features
🔥 Flame detection using IR-based sensors

🚗 Autonomous movement toward the fire

💨 Fan-based fire extinguishing mechanism

📱 SMS & Call alert using GSM module (SIM800L)

🪫 Power efficient and portable design

🛠️ Easy to replicate using off-the-shelf components


✅ Future Improvements
Obstacle avoidance while navigating to fire

Integration with IoT dashboards for remote control
